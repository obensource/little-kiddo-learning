## Constructive Educational Shows

Be 100% intentional about which shows your kiddos are allowed to engage with. Subjecting them to the 'everything and the kitchen sink' outlet that standard television facilitates (with it's unpredictable social content and mindless entertainment) will likely distract or stall a child's development. Even shows marketed as 'educational' can leave much to be desired. There are a handful of brilliant educational shows that engage with children in a [constructionist](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)>) way–such that the programming doesn't push the viewer off the precipice of foundational learning into the realm of pseudo-learning or distraction.
