## Writing

- Write their name together, and the names of their family members and friends.
- Write out the alphabet together.
- Put together familiar words with an [Alphabet Stamp Set](https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Alphabet-Stamp-Set/dp/B00UX9DPUA/).
- Write a card together for a family member or friend. Have fun coming up with a short message and writing it out together.
- Connect known words from other languages with how they're spelled out in that language's alphabet, and write them out together.
  - Example: my kiddo loves the film ['My Neighbor Tototo'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Neighbor_Totoro) which has 2 lead characters named Sasuki and Mei, which is written as **さすき** (Sasuki), and **めい** (Mei) in [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) (Japanese phonetic alphabet). This makes it easy to introduce and acclimate the concept of phonetic alphabets when writing out the names of her favorite characters: **さ**('Sa') **す**('su') **き**('ki'), **め**('Me') **い**('i').
  - Further word-spelling fun can be done by differentiating the concepts of alphabetic, logographic, and phonetic written languages: like the [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet), [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji), and [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) (respectively). Logographic languages like Kanji are super fun to share because they're pictographic (you get to draw a picture of what you mean).
    - For example: **木** means tree, **森** means forest (3 trees), **本** means book (the extra line represents a cut-down tree). Then pictographic identities compound when combined together, like **日本語** (Nihongo: the Japanese language). **日** (Ni - 'sun') the first character in **日本** (Nihon – the word for 'Japan'), **本** (Hon - 'origin') the second character–when compounded with the first literally translates to "the sun's origin' (or the colloquial 'land of the rising sun'). Finally **語** (Go - 'language') adds the characteristic of this word referring to an established language (as is appended to every word for a specific language, like: **英語** Eigo - 'English', or **ドイツ語** Doitsugo - 'German').
