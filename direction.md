## Direction

- The 'Direct me!' Game:
  - Left/Right: When outside in a large open space, put them on your back or shoulders and start walking at a slow pace without stopping. Ask them to direct you to go left or right as you go in order to avoid walking into walls, etc, while making your way towards a predetermined destination.
  - Cardinal Directions (N/S/E/W): Level up with talking about the cardinal directions, getting them comfortable with opposite directions (N is opposite of South, East vs. West). Have them point at each direction with you while doing this. Then ask them to hop on your back and tell you where to go with the 'direct me' game!
    - Can be reinforced by doing these activities with a compass, and talking about the North star (how sailors used it to know which direction they were travelling in). ['The Big Dipper'](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Dipper-Lets-Read-Find-Out-Science/dp/0064451003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529899999&sr=8-1&keywords=the+big+dipper+book) book explores this concept well in an accessible way.
  - Have fun talking about and summarizing direction with the ['direction tractor'](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Inductive-Follows-Children-Random/dp/B076XKXQK5/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_21_bs_tr_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1RK8X9B2K0BCJDBPQFCV)!
