# Introducing Kiddos to a Big World of Awesomeness üåéüåçüåè
If you have a little kiddo in your life and are responsible for their upbringing in any capacity‚Äìyou're probably familiar with the impassioned feeling of wanting to do everything you can to make sure they get to explore as much of this big, awesome, diverse world of thoughts and experiences as possible.

## Doing What Works
These resources are based on the personal experience of teaching and sharing them with a little kiddo in my life. Nothing here is untested, and everything has been done with positive results. üôå

## General Advice
### Free to grow
Don't step in too fast. Let the kiddo sit and think about something a bit, even repeating a question or trying to draw their attention back to it again before providing an answer.

### Don't hold back
Never be afraid to cover difficult, or seemingly 'adult' concepts. They're learning constructively by doing and enjoying fun activities with you in these early moments. Understanding the deeper matter of these complicated concepts will come later, but having a fundamental engagement and familiarity with them early on will make it much easier when they get there.

### Unhindering their learning environment
Fight against cultural barriers around specific subjects. These biases are usually formed based on the experiences of personal upbringing, and the culture one was raised in or lives in now. We should never teach our children that 'math is for math-people', or 'programming is for a certain kind of person'. If we open up an unhinged world of discovery on the onset, they may learn to cherish the interplay of all these things‚Äìwhile not being held back in letting them enrich their lives collectively.

## Words
* 'Word walks'
  * Talking about all the objects along the way with your kiddo while going on a walk.
* 'Keyboard-Smasher' software
  * When kiddos are just learning to talk, they've begun their journey into associating words with symbols. Keyboard-Smasher games are awesome for interactively streamlining word association with objects, animals, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, etc‚Äìwhich pop up on the screen when a button is pressed or mouse is clicked.
  * I went with [bambam](https://github.com/porridge/bambam) since it was relatively up-to-date, and easy to grab more images and drop them into the game's image folder it grabs them from as the child's vocabulary grew. I also set this up on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to avoid the danger of 'smashing' my work computer.
  * [BabySmash](http://babysmash.com/) is a popular one.
  * [AlphaBaby](http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/) is a great one, but is out of date. It may still run on some older machines.

## Reading
* Reading books everyday, constantly. Inbetween physical activities, or whenever there's down time.
* [Pooh's First Words Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Winnie-Learning-Cards-Decks/dp/B008440UWC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527402525&sr=8-1&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+flash+cards)
  * Associate verbs and nouns with fun characters they like.
* [Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head Alphebet Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Playskool-Prek-K-Flash-Cards-featuring/dp/B077HPGY73/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527402791&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=mr+potato+head+abc+cards)
  * Gains understanding of 'big' and 'little' letters (upper and lower case).
* Question: 'What is an Alphebet'? Answer: 'A group of letters'.
  * Ask this during flash card sessions.
  * Have them repeat the answer.
  * Show them 'alphebets' from other languages to support the concept, for example: a [hiragana chart](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2016-04-05-hiragana-chart/happylilac-hiragana-chart.pdf) (Japanese).
