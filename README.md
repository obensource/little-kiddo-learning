# Introducing Kiddos to a Big World of Awesomeness üåéüåçüåè
If you have a little kiddo in your life and are responsible for their upbringing in any capacity‚Äìyou're probably familiar with the impassioned feeling of wanting to do everything you can to make sure they get to explore as much of this big, awesome, diverse world of thoughts and experiences as possible.

## Doing What Works
These resources are based on the personal experience of teaching and sharing them with a little kiddo in my life. Nothing here is untested, and everything has been done with positive results. üôå

## General Advice
### Free to grow
Don't step in too fast. Let the kiddo sit and think about something a bit, even repeating a question or trying to draw their attention back to it again before providing an answer.

### Don't hold back
Never be afraid to cover difficult, or seemingly 'adult' concepts. They're learning constructively by doing and enjoying fun activities with you in these early moments. Understanding the deeper matter of these complicated concepts will come later, but having a fundamental engagement and familiarity with them early on will make it much easier when they get there.

### Unhindering their learning environment
Fight against cultural barriers around specific subjects. These biases are usually formed based on the experiences of personal upbringing, and the culture one was raised in or lives in now. We should never teach our children that 'math is for math-people', or 'programming is for a certain kind of person'. If we open up an unhinged world of discovery on the onset, they may learn to cherish the interplay of all these things‚Äìwhile not being held back in letting them enrich their lives collectively.

## Words
* 'Word walks'
  * Talking about all the objects along the way with your kiddo while going on a walk.
* 'Keyboard-Smasher' software
  * When kiddos are just learning to talk, they've begun their journey into associating words with symbols. Keyboard-Smasher games are awesome for interactively streamlining word association with objects, animals, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, etc‚Äìwhich pop up on the screen when a button is pressed or mouse is clicked.
  * I went with [bambam](https://github.com/porridge/bambam) since it was relatively up-to-date, and easy to grab more images and drop them into the game's image folder it grabs them from as the child's vocabulary grew. I also set this up on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to avoid the danger of 'smashing' my work computer.
  * [BabySmash](http://babysmash.com/) is a popular one.
  * [AlphaBaby](http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/) is a great one, but is out of date. It may still run on some older machines.

## Reading
* Reading books everyday, constantly. Inbetween physical activities, or whenever there's down time.
* Singing the ABCs song every night together twice while brushing our teeth (one time per row).
* [Pooh's First Words Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Winnie-Learning-Cards-Decks/dp/B008440UWC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527402525&sr=8-1&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+flash+cards)
  * Associate verbs and nouns with fun characters they like.
* [Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head Alphebet Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Playskool-Prek-K-Flash-Cards-featuring/dp/B077HPGY73/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527402791&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=mr+potato+head+abc+cards)
  * Gains understanding of 'big' and 'little' letters (upper and lower case).
* Question: 'What is an Alphebet'? Answer: 'A group of letters'.
  * Ask this during flash card sessions.
  * Have them repeat the answer.
  * Show them 'alphebets' from other languages to support the concept, for example: a [hiragana chart](https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japanese/2016-04-05-hiragana-chart/happylilac-hiragana-chart.pdf) (Japanese).
  
## Writing
* Write their name together, and the names of their family members and friends.
* Write out the alphebet together.
* Put together familiar words with an [Alphabet Stamp Set](https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Alphabet-Stamp-Set/dp/B00UX9DPUA/).
* Write a card together for a family member or friend. Have fun coming up with a short message and writing it out together.

## Numbers
* Count **everything** together. One by one.
* Frequently ask 'how many are there?' about **everything**.
* [Pooh's Number Match Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Winnie-Learning-Cards-Decks/dp/B008440UWC/), and [Eric Carle Number Flash Cards](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/toys-games-the-world-of-eric-carle/29225519/2679919942343).
  * Make the association between a number as a symbol, and the number of items it represents.
  * Understand that numbers can be represented by both a word and a symbol.
* [BabySmash](http://babysmash.com/) for a fun 'pop up' number guessing activity.
* Reinforce numbers everywhere:
  * Point out that numbers are on the pages of their books when reading together. 
  * 'Calculator fun!': show that numbers (as symbols) are used in everyday things. Count up from one together, pressing each representative button while saying the number out loud.
* Decimals:
  * Talk about how numbers are grouped by 10s, and then ask 'Why? Is it because we have 10 toes and 10 fingers?' (then count to 20 on their toes and fingers).
  * Reinforce with counting by 10s with the Abacus (see [Math](./README.md#math)).
  * Reinforce with dimes: introduce the dollar as a whole unit made up of 10 dimes, and then break the dime down as a unit of 10 pennies. Then mention that the dollar is a collection of 100 pennies.
* Radix: introduce them to the fact numbers don't just have to count up to 10 to be useful. They can count to less than 10‚Äìlike 2 (binary) or 8 (octal), or more than 10‚Äìlike 16 (hexadecimal). Mention that counting in 10s is useful to people, but counting in these other ways can be useful to computers, robots, and other machines that people use to do amazing things.

## Math
* 'Fruit Math': Count, add, and subtract using a group of fruits.
* 'Sandwich Fractions': Whenever you can, make a sandwhich together and talk about each fraction made as you cut it into 4 quarters.
  * 'This is a whole sandwhich, now 2 halves, now 3 thirds, now 4 quarters!'
* 'Piano Fractions': Play two notes an octave apart, and ask 'Can you hear that they sound the same? That's means these notes are a whole octave!' Then ask 'how many notes are in between?', count the 12 notes, and ask 'how many notes make up the whole octave?'
  * 'How many white notes and black notes make up the ocatave?' (8 and 5)?
  * '1/2 of 12 is what (6)? Great, can you hear how when we play the 1 and 6 note together it sounds agreeable (a 4th)? How about when we play the 1 and 8 note together? That sounds awesome too (a 5th)!'
* [Abacus (IKEA)](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10387614/)
  * Reinforce numbers as a grouping of single objects.
  * Grasp basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and [modulo](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic) operations.
    * First help them to understand the definition of these words: "A division is when you take a whole thing and break it up into parts."
    * The following examples intend to be a starting point from which you can spring into using larger numbers and work towards deeper reinforcement.
    * Addition: Start with the top row of beads and talk about addition‚Äì"Ok I have one bead, now how many do I have if I add 1 more, how about 3 more?"
    * Subtraction: Start with the top row of beads and talk about subtraction‚Äì"Ok I have five beads, now how many do I have if I take away 1, what if I take away 3 more?"
    * Multiplication: Count the first row of 10 beads, then help them understand they can count the proceeding rows by 10, reaching 100 much quicker than counting single beads.
    * Division: Count the first row of 10 beads, break them into 2 sets of 5, and ask‚Äìhow many 5's can go into 10 beads? 2? So 10 divided by 2 is 5? And that means half of 10 is 5 right? (reinforce fractions).
    * Modulo: Count 5 beads and ask: "How many 2's go into this group of 5 beads? 2? Oh, then how many are left over? Awesome, our answer is 1!" Repeat with 6 modulo 2, "Ok, so none are left over this time! Our answer is 2!"
* Count coins. Start with 'how many', counting them sequentially as objects. Then talk about the assigned values of the coins (pennies, nickels, dimes), and try to add and subtract them by value. Multiplication, division, and modulo operations can be reinforced as well.
* 'Calculator Fun': reinforce arithmetic operations with symbols. "See! 5 times 2 is 10! The number machine says so!"

## Geometry
* Introduction to shapes:
  * [BabySmash](http://babysmash.com/) introduction to shapes, including polygons.
    * While doing this, ask: "how many sides does this shape have? (reinforcing polygon identification)"
  * [Pooh's Color's and Shapes Flash Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Winnie-Learning-Cards-Decks/dp/B008440UWC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527402525&sr=8-1&keywords=winnie+the+pooh+flash+cards)
  * Draw shapes together in a sandbox.
* Shape match game: [Fold a paper into 3rds](https://cdn.instructables.com/FKI/ENYK/HJKBSY7L/FKIENYKHJKBSY7L.LARGE.jpg), cut out various shapes along each crease, give them the cut-out shapes, and have them match them up on the paper while identifying which shape they are.
* 'Shapes in the world' game: Anywhere, in any environment‚Äìask them what shapes things around them are made out of. For example‚Äìa trampoline is a circle, and a house is a mix of squares, rectangles, triangles, circles, etc. "What shapes are in that cloud? What shape is the moon?"
* Draw an outside scene together in the form of shapes.
* 'Shapes in a picture' game: Take a picture, print it out. Discover the shapes within it, and cut them out together.
* 'Fruit Shapes': Cut a citrus fruit (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) in half and ask what shapes they see (the half is a circle, the inner sections are now triangles). Then reinforce numbers with counting the number of sections, and how many of them make the whole fruit (fractions).
* Angles: Make an animal (cat, dog, bird) together out of triangles.
  * Can draw, or cut out a lot of paper triangles to paste together.
  * Introduces the concept of angles with obtuse, acute, and right triangles.
* Trapezoids: Create your own 4 sided shapes together by drawing or with paper cut outs.
* Polygons:
  * Reinforcing polagonal 'sides' by drawing each shape together. 1: line, 2: angle, 3: triangle, 4: square, 5: pentagon, etc. Each time you draw a new shape, circle and count each point to reinforce the polygon's identity. Once you get to 12 or more, ask 'what shape is this starting to look like?' (a circle).
  * 'Polygon star game': starting with a pentagon, explore [the stars]() you can create together when connecting the points within polygons. Ask if they can see the shapes within the stars (squares, triangles, rectangles). If drawn, cut out and hang the stars in their play area for fun.

## Physics
* Introduction to gravity, force, mass, and inertia:
  * Watch Bill Nye the Science Guy, [Season 1, episode 6 ('Gravity')](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3cpv1v) together (available on Netflix).
    * Talk about how the earth spins around the Sun, while spinning at the same time, and pushes everything down towards it center.
    * Ask them to jump, and then ask "why did you come back down when you jumped up?"
    * Tie understanding gravity into talking about orbit, and how the planets all spin around the Sun because of its gravitational pull.
  * 'Soccer Ball Physics': When kicking a soccer ball together, talk about how everthing has mass. And how force affects things with mass like the soccer ball (the force from our legs kicking it). 
    * Gravity: Then throw the soccer ball in the air, and ask: "why does the ball come right back down to me after I throw it up in the air?"
    * Inertia: Then talk about how the ball is doing nothing until I kick it. It's just going to keep doing nothing... and nothing... and nothing... until something does something to it! Then ask, "Why doesn't the ball just keep going after I kick it?" Ask if they can see that the grass slows it down until it stops. "Why? Inertia! It might just keep on going into space if it didn't have stuff affecting it like gravity and inertia!"
  * 'Bouncy Ball Physics': Reinforce 'Soccer Ball Physics' with a bouncy ball when playing inside.
  * 'Gear Train Physics': With a set of [Gear Magnets](http://tomy.com/toomies/gearation-refrigerator-magnets?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsPjQvtvq2wIVRYF-Ch0m5QD4EAQYASABEgLfyvD_BwE), talk about how the force of the first gear transfers to each one you add on, affecting the speed of each one differently depending on their size and shape.

## Direction
* The 'Direct me!' Game:
  * Left/Right: When outside in a large open space, put them on your back or shoulders and start walking at a slow pace without stopping. Ask them to direct you to go left or right as you go in order to avoid walking into walls, etc, while making your way towards a predetermined destination.
  * Cardinal Directions (N/S/E/W): Level up with talking about the cardinal directions, getting them comfortable with opposite directions (N is opposite of South, East vs. West). Have them point at each direction with you while doing this. Then ask them to hop on your back and tell you where to go with the 'direct me' game!
    * Can be reinforced by doing these activities with a compass, and talking about the North star (how sailors used it to know which direction they were travelling in). ['The Big Dipper'](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Dipper-Lets-Read-Find-Out-Science/dp/0064451003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529899999&sr=8-1&keywords=the+big+dipper+book) book explores this concept well in an accessible way.
  * Have fun talking about and summarizing direction with the ['direction tractor'](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Inductive-Follows-Children-Random/dp/B076XKXQK5/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_21_bs_tr_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1RK8X9B2K0BCJDBPQFCV)!
