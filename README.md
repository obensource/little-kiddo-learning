If you have a little kiddo in your life and are responsible for their upbringing in any capacity‚Äìyou're probably familiar with the impassioned feeling of wanting to do everything you can to make sure they get to explore as much of this big, awesome, diverse world of thoughts and experiences as possible.

## Doing What Works

These resources are based on the personal experience of teaching and sharing them with a little kiddo in my life. Nothing here is untested, and everything has been done with positive results. üôå

## General Advice

### Free to grow

Don't step in too fast. Let the kiddo sit and think about something a bit, even repeating a question or trying to draw their attention back to it again before providing an answer.

### Don't hold back

Never be afraid to cover difficult, or seemingly 'adult' concepts. They're learning constructively by doing and enjoying fun activities with you in these early moments. Understanding the deeper matter of these complicated concepts will come later, but having a fundamental engagement and familiarity with them early on will make it much easier when they get there.

### Unhindering their learning environment

Fight against cultural barriers around specific subjects. These biases are usually formed based on the experiences of personal upbringing, and the culture one was raised in or lives in now. We should never teach our children that 'math is for math-people', or 'programming is for a certain kind of person'. If we open up an unhinged world of discovery on the onset, they may learn to cherish the interplay of all these things‚Äìwhile not being held back in letting them enrich their lives collectively.
