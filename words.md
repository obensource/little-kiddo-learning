## Words

### 'Word walks'

Talking about all the objects along the way with your kiddo while going on a walk.

### 'Keyboard-Smasher' software

When kiddos are just learning to talk, they've begun their journey into associating words with symbols. Keyboard-Smasher games are awesome for interactively streamlining word association with objects, animals, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, etcâ€“which pop up on the screen when a button is pressed or mouse is clicked.

I went with [bambam](https://github.com/porridge/bambam) since it was relatively up-to-date, and easy to grab more images and drop them into the game's image folder it grabs them from as the child's vocabulary grew. I also set this up on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to avoid the danger of 'smashing' my work computer.

#### Examples

- [BabySmash](http://babysmash.com/) is a popular one.
- [AlphaBaby](http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/) is a great one, but is out of date. It may still run on some older machines.
