## Astronomy

- Look up at the sky together and learn about what's out there with a 'star guide' app. Example: [Star Walk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-for-ipad-interactive/id363486802?mt=8)
- Introduce and/or reinforce the concept of constellations with an introductory book like '[The Big Dipper](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Dipper-Publisher-Collins-Revised/dp/B004QDSJ8C)'.
- Watch Bill Nye the Science Guy, [Season 3, episode 1 ('Planets & Moons')](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3jyutv) together (available on Netflix).
- Continually reference the Earth as 'our planet', or 'the planet we live on'. Relate in terms of other planets, our Sun, and other Solar systems.
- Reinforce the concept of gravity by talking about:
  - How the Sun's gravity keeps all the other planets spinning around it–planets don't just fly around in space.
  - Planets' gravity keep moons spinning around them.
- Then introduce orbits (and their relation to gravity): planets orbit around the sun, moons orbit around planets.
- Planets are always spinning! Reinforce this concept by talking about sunrises and sunsets:
  - 'When the sun is going up the earth is spinning towards the sun.'
  - 'When the sun is going down the earth is spinning away from the sun.'
- Magnetism: consider together that the Earth's poles are magnetic, and that there is a north magnetic-pole, and south magnetic-pole. Discover how the direction of the north pole can be found together by using a compass!
- Seasons and Temperatures: talk about the season you're currently in, and how the temperature is that way because the Earth's spins around its pole–which doesn't 'stand up straight'. So it's colder or hotter based on which way the earth is tilted during its year-long trip around the Sun!
- If you have access to one, visit your local Planetarium! (Example: Periodically catch a show at [OMSI's Planetarium](https://omsi.edu/planetarium) together and learn about stuff like solar systems and dark matter!)
